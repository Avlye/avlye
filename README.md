#### More About Me

I study Analysis and Systems Development at the Technical Faculty (FATEC) in Brazil. I worked on Diolinux, LinuxSociALL, and contributed to other projects focused on Open Source.

Heavily interested in Web & App Development, and with experience in SEO and Front End performance optimization, mostly my skills involve UI Design and JavaScript ‚ù§.

Getting good foundations in Full Stack Development is vital for me, so I always look for an opportunity to learn and contribute to Back End Oriented Technology.

What about my tech skills  & goals?
Focused on HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, I love working with SASS, React, and TypeScript. Besides some previous fundamental experience with Web2py (Python) and Ruby on Rails in 2013-2016, I'm looking to upgrade my level into Back End Development.

I'd love to get a job as entry-level in Web Development this year, with good experience in SEO, I'd love to share the knowledge I got working on Diolinux.
What is my previous experience?
I mainly worked on Diolinux, a well-known project about Linux and Open Source through his philosophy of Freedom of Knowledge, created a fantastic person called Dionatan Simioni.

Back in 2013, Web Designers often had to do the entire development process, from UI Design to some Back End Development. I learned so many things while at work on many projects.

Besides being mainly responsible for improving blog performance & SEO, I also was responsible for ensuring good interactivity and accessibility, helping into E-Commerce maintenance, often supporting readers and customers.

Mostly Used Technologies:
‚Ä¢ Blogger Templating Language
‚Ä¢ HTML, CSS and JavaScript
‚Ä¢ JQuery and Ajax
‚Ä¢ Web2py

What Open Source projects are you proud to have contributed?
I contributed to two different versions of Sails.js, an MVC Framework to JavaScript inspired by Ruby on Rails, focused on translating Sails documentation to Brazilian Portuguese.

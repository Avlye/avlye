### Hi, it's great you're here! 👋

I'm Gabriel Almir, also known as Avlye, a Front End Developer with design roots.

- 😄 Ruby on Rails still my favorite backend framework.

#### About Me

I study Analysis and Systems Development at the Technical Faculty (FATEC) in Brazil. I worked on Diolinux, LinuxSociALL, and contributed to other projects focused on Open Source.

Heavily interested in Web & App Development, and with experience in SEO and Front End performance optimization, mostly my skills involve UI Design and JavaScript ❤.

Getting good foundations in Full Stack Development is vital for me, so I always look for an opportunity to learn and contribute to Back End Oriented Technology.

What about my tech skills  & goals?
Focused on HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, I love working with SASS, React, and TypeScript. Besides some previous fundamental experience with Web2py (Python) and Ruby on Rails in 2013-2016, I'm looking to upgrade my level into Back End Development.

I'd love to get a job as entry-level in Web Development this year, with good experience in SEO, I'd love to share the knowledge I got working on Diolinux.

I love learning new things, contributing to projects, supporting beginners, and also I'd enjoy getting in touch. 💬

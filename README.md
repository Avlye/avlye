I study Analysis and Systems Development at the Technical Faculty (FATEC) in Brazil.
Heavily interested in Web & App Development, and with experience in SEO and Front End performance optimization, mostly my skills involve UI Design and JavaScript ‚ù§.

- üå± Learning React & TypeScript.
- ‚ö° Fun fact: When I worked on Diolinux, my nickname was kewer.
- üì´ How to reach me: [avlye.vee@gmail.com](mailto:avlye.vee@gmail.com) & [my Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/avlye/).
- üí¨ Feel free to ask me about Web Development.

I had previous experience with Web2py (a Python MVC Web Framework) and Ruby on Rails from 2013 to 2016, getting good foundations in Full Stack Development is vital for me, so I always look for an opportunity to learn and contribute to Back End Oriented Technology.

I'd love to get a job in Web Development this year, with good experience in SEO, I'd love to share the knowledge I got working on Diolinux.

I love learning new things, contributing to projects, supporting beginners, and also I'd enjoy getting in touch. üí¨
